Build Your Portfolio: 1st Web Project
Jerilyn Womack

This project is for a fictitious restaurant called "La Botellita" (the little bottle). 
It is a simple site that allows the user to view the menu, place an online order to go, 
and make a reservation online. The site also gives the user information about where to 
follow them on social media platforms to keep up with new menu items or special offers 
and events the restaurant is running. 

The functionality of the site includes nav bars that let the user navigate from one page
to the next. When a user scrolls all the way down to the bottom of the page, there's a 
back to top button on each page that lets the user jump back to the top so they don't 
have to continuosly scroll up and down. When a user places a to go order or makes a 
reservation, the site will not process the request unless all required fields are filled 
out and if the user clicks the button and has forgotten to fill out a required field the site 
will let them know to fill out the required field. 

The technologies used for this site include:
- 4 html pages that are linked to eachother
- A css styling page that styles all pages of the site
- A javascript file used to add a carousel feature to the home page

Ideas for future improvement:
- A sticky back to the top button that will scroll with the user no matter where they are on the page.
- A second nav bar on the menu page that lets the user jump to different sections of the menu to reduce scrolling.
- A pop-up message on the forms the user fills out that lets them know their request has been submitted.
